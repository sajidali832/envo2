## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, calming blue (#75A9FF) to instill trust and reliability in the investment platform.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E8F0FE) to create a clean, uncluttered feel, ensuring focus on the content.
- Accent color: Muted yellow (#D4AC0D) for highlights, call-to-action buttons, and important notifications, offering a gentle contrast without overwhelming the soft blue tones.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to give a touch of warmth combined with a modern look; to be used throughout the application to maintain legibility.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a techy feel, complementing the softer body text and overall calming theme; good for drawing user attention, but easy to read.
- Simple, line-style icons to represent different investment and withdrawal options. Each icon should be easily understandable at a glance.
- A clear, mobile-first layout emphasizing readability and ease of use on smaller screens. Information should be organized logically, prioritizing key actions.
